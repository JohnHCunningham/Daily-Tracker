2. **Saves to Supabase** → PostgreSQL database
3. **AI analyzes patterns** → RAG coaching system
4. **Displays insights** → Beautiful visualizations

### AI Coaching Algorithm
The RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system:
1. Queries your historical data (30 days)
2. Calculates key metrics (conversion rates, consistency, etc.)
3. Compares to industry benchmarks
4. Generates personalized insights
5. Prioritizes suggestions (high/medium/low)
6. Saves to `coaching_insights` table
