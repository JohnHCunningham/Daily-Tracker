## 💔 PROBLEM SECTION

### Headline
**Your Sales Team Knows the Methodology. But Are They Actually Using It?**

### Pain Points (3-column layout)

**❌ Inconsistent Execution**
Your reps attended the training. They have the playbook. But on actual calls, they forget the pain funnel, skip the up-front contract, and jump straight to pitching.

**❌ Coaching That Doesn't Scale**
You can't listen to every call. Manual call reviews take hours. By the time you give feedback, the opportunity is already lost.

**❌ No Visibility Into What's Working**
You see the numbers (dials, meetings, close rate) but you don't know WHY deals are won or lost. Which part of your methodology is breaking down?

## ✅ SOLUTION SECTION

### Headline
**AI That Coaches Your Team Like You Would—But for Every Single Call**

### Subheadline
Upload a sales conversation. Get instant, methodology-specific coaching with exact scripts to use next time.

### Solution Points (3-column with icons)

**🎯 Instant Analysis**
Upload a call transcript or recording. Our AI analyzes it against YOUR methodology (Sandler, MEDDIC, Challenger—you choose) and YOUR scripts in under 30 seconds.

**📝 Tactical Scripts, Not Generic Advice**
No fluff. Get specific, word-for-word scripts: "When they say 'send me info,' respond with..." Reps know exactly what to say on their next call.

**📈 Track What Matters**
See which methodology principles your team executes well (and which they skip). Identify patterns: Are reps talking too much? Skipping budget discussions? Data tells the story.
