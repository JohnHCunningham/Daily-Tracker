## The Science - Why This Works

**Long-term behavioral change requires TWO mechanisms:**

**1. Transparency (Visibility)**
- Candy Bowl Study: 50% reduction when mirrors present
- Hawthorne Effect: 20-30% productivity increase when measured
- Application: Radial charts show RED (below average) → reps self-correct

**2. Immediate Feedback (Speed)**
- Research: Feedback within 30 seconds is 5x more effective than quarterly reviews
- Delayed feedback doesn't stick - bad habits already formed
- Application: AI analyzes every call in real-time, reps adjust before next conversation

**Key Insight:** You don't need to micromanage. Just make execution visible and provide instant feedback.

## Ideal Customer
- 5-50 sales reps
- Trained in a methodology but struggling with execution under pressure
- Managers spending hours manually reviewing calls

---

## Qualifying Questions (Natural Flow)
1. "How many reps do you have?"
2. "Using a methodology like Sandler or MEDDIC?"
3. "What's your biggest execution challenge?"
4. "Do reps stick to the methodology under pressure?"
5. "How much time do you spend reviewing calls weekly?"
6. "When do reps get feedback - immediately or days later?"

---

## Positioning (Qualified Leads)

"Sounds like you have training in place, but execution gap costs deals and hours weekly.

What changes: Ten radial charts, one per rep. See calls, emails, meetings, methodology execution vs team average. Spot struggle. Click once. Three seconds later, complete coaching report.

Reps get feedback within 30 seconds - not weeks later when bad habit is formed. Adjust before next call.

Not surveillance. Candy bowl study - people behave better when they can see themselves. Science proves it."

---

## Key Differentiators
1. **Data Ownership**: Never shared, sold, or used for training. We make money helping you win, not selling your data.
2. **One-Click Coaching**: 3 seconds vs 3 hours of manual review
3. **Science-Based**: Behavioral psychology, not surveillance
4. **Methodology-Specific**: Coaching matched to YOUR playbook, not generic

---

## Objection Handling

**"Already have a CRM"**
Perfect! We complement CRM. CRM tracks results, we track behavior. We show WHY deals win or lose.

**"Different from Gong?"**
Gong is great for conversation intelligence. We add one-click coaching and methodology scorecards. Critically: they use your data to train AI across customers. We never do. Your data is yours.

**"Reps will hate monitoring"**
Opposite. Candy bowl study - 50% less candy when mirrors present. Not surveillance, self-awareness. Reps see RED on radial chart, they fix it. Best reps love it like athletes love game film.

**"Data security?"**
Exactly why we built this way. Your data is yours. Always. Never shared, sold, or used to train AI. Enterprise encryption, role-based access. Most platforms make money selling data. We make money helping you win.
