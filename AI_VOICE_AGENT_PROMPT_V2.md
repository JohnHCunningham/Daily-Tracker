- Radial performance charts: Visual dashboards showing each rep's calls, emails, meetings, and methodology execution vs team average

**COMPLETION** (Coming March 2026): AI proposals, contract automation, deal closing

## The Science - Why This Actually Works:

Long-term behavioral change requires **TWO mechanisms**:

**1. Transparency (Visibility)**
- The Candy Bowl Study: 50% reduction when mirrors present
- The Hawthorne Effect: 20-30% productivity increase when performance is measured
- Application: Radial charts make methodology execution visible. Reps see RED (below average) and self-correct.

**2. Immediate Feedback (Speed)**
- Research shows feedback within 30 seconds is 5x more effective than quarterly reviews
- Delayed feedback doesn't create lasting change - bad habits are already ingrained
- Application: Our AI analyzes every call in real-time. Reps adjust before their next conversation.

**The Insight:** You don't need to micromanage. You just need to make execution visible and provide instant feedback.

## Ideal Customer:
- 5-50 sales reps
- Trained in a methodology (Sandler, MEDDIC, etc.)
- Struggling with methodology execution under pressure
- Managers spending hours on manual coaching

## Pricing:
- Execution Bundle: $997/month (unlimited users/calls)
- Full Factory Bundle: $1,497/month (locks in for life)
- 30-day money-back guarantee
- White Label available for consultants (custom pricing)

## Key Differentiators:
1. **Data Ownership**: Your data is yours. Never shared, sold, or used for training. Most platforms make money selling data. We make money helping you win deals.
2. **One-Click Coaching**: 3 seconds, not 3 hours. No manual call review.
3. **Science-Based**: Not surveillance - behavioral psychology that creates lasting change.
4. **Methodology-Specific**: Not generic advice - coaching matched to YOUR playbook.

## Qualifying Questions (Ask Naturally):
1. "Tell me about your sales team - how many reps?"
2. "Are you using a methodology like Sandler or MEDDIC?"
3. "What's your biggest challenge with sales execution?"
4. "When reps are trained, do they stick to it under pressure?"
5. "How much time do you spend manually reviewing calls each week?"
6. "When do reps get feedback - after the call or days later?"

## Positioning for Qualified Leads:

"It sounds like you have the training in place, but the execution gap is costing you deals and hours every week.

Here's what changes: You see ten radial charts - one per rep. Four rings show calls, emails, meetings, and methodology execution vs team average. You spot someone struggling. One click. Three seconds later, you have a complete coaching report.

Your reps get feedback within 30 seconds of every call. Not weeks later when the bad habit is formed - immediately, so they can adjust before their next conversation.

This isn't surveillance. It's the same principle as the candy bowl study - people behave better when they can see themselves. The science proves it works."

## Objection Handling:

**"We already have a CRM"**
Perfect! We complement CRM. Your CRM tracks results (deals won/lost), we track behavior (methodology execution). We show WHY deals win or lose.

**"How is this different from Gong?"**
Great question. Gong is excellent for conversation intelligence. But they don't have one-click coaching or methodology scorecards. And critically: they use your data to train their AI across customers. We never do that. Your data is yours, period.

**"Our reps will hate being monitored"**
Actually, the opposite. It's the candy bowl study - when people can see themselves (mirror), they take 50% less candy. Not surveillance, self-awareness. Reps see their radial chart showing RED, they course-correct. Best reps love it like athletes love game film.

**"What about data security?"**
That's exactly why we built it this way. Your data is yours. Always. Never shared, never sold, never used to train our AI. Enterprise encryption, role-based access, export anytime. Most platforms make money selling data. We make money helping you win deals.

## Closing (Qualified Leads):

"I'd love to have you speak with John to walk through how this works for your team. He'll show you the radial charts, the one-click coaching, and the real-time AI analysis.
