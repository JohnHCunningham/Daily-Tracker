**[Point to the cards]**

- **Lisa (red border, pulsing)**: "All red rings - critical, needs immediate attention"

**YOU:** "Each rep has 4 performance rings - Dials, Conversations, Meetings, Sales. Color shows performance vs expected. This is instant visibility."

---

### **PART 2: Achievement Badges (1 minute)**

**YOU:** "Now watch this - see these badges in the top-right corners?"

**[Point to Sarah's badges: 🔥🔥 and ⭐]**

**[Point to Lisa's card - now shows "💬 Coached ⏳ 2 hours ago"]**

**YOU:** "Orange border means coaching sent but unread. When she reads it, this greys out. Total transparency."

**[Click "Awesome!" to close modal]**

### **PART 4: Team Celebration Feed (1 minute)**

**YOU:** "Scroll down - this is the team wins feed."

**[Scroll to "Recent Team Wins" section]**

**YOU:** "Last 24 hours of milestones across the team:"

**[Point to each celebration]**

- **Tom Williams**: "🏆 SPIN Methodology Master - he executed the full SPIN sequence 5 calls in a row"
- **Mike Chen**: "💰 First Sale Closed - $25,000 - his first deal ever"
- **Sarah Johnson**: "🔥 10-Day Streak - discipline and consistency"

**YOU:** "This isn't a leaderboard. This isn't rep vs rep toxicity. This is you vs yesterday. Every win visible. Every improvement celebrated."

---

### **PART 5: Table View (1 minute)**

**[Click "📋 Table View" button at top]**

**YOU:** "For detailed analysis, we have sortable table view."

**[Click "Status" column header]**

**YOU:** "Click any column to sort. Status column shows critical reps first. Dials column shows activity leaders. Every metric color-coded the same way."

**[Click "📊 Card View" to go back]**

---

### **PART 6: The Psychology (1 minute - CLOSING)**

**YOU:** "Here's why this matters..."

**"Most sales tools punish failure. Track what's wrong. Make reps feel like they're being watched."**

**"The Revenue Factory does the opposite:"**

- **Private coaching** when you're off track
- **Public celebration** when you win
- **Immediate feedback** - no waiting for Friday reviews
- **Visible progress** - you see yourself improving

**"Sales reps don't quit jobs. They quit feeling invisible."**

**"We make wins undeniable."**

**[Pause]**

**"That's The Revenue Factory."**

## 💡 ANTICIPATED QUESTIONS

### **Q: "Is this using real data or demo data?"**
**A:** "This is demo data for the presentation. In production, these radial rings and achievements update in real-time as reps log activity. The AI coaching analyzes actual call transcripts and metrics."

### **Q: "How does the AI know what to coach?"**
**A:** "We built methodology-specific coaching intelligence. If your rep uses Sandler, AI knows to check for upfront contract, pain funnel, budget discussion. MEDDIC reps get coached on metrics, economic buyer, decision criteria. It's not generic - it's methodology-aware."

### **Q: "Won't public celebrations create pressure?"**
**A:** "That's why we celebrate personal bests, not rankings. Sarah isn't competing with Mike. She's competing with herself. We celebrate improvement - first sale, first streak, methodology mastery. No leaderboards. No shame."

### **Q: "What if a rep is struggling? Do they see others winning while they're failing?"**
**A:** "Great question. When Lisa is in critical status, she gets private AI coaching immediately. She also earns achievements for progress - like 'First Coaching Received.' We celebrate the journey, not just the destination. And her coaching is private - only she and her manager see it."

### **Q: "Can we customize the methodologies?"**
**A:** "Absolutely. We support Sandler, MEDDIC, Challenger, SPIN, Gap Selling out of the box. You can also build custom methodologies with your own execution criteria."
